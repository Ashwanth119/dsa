**ðŸ“˜ DSA Prep Sheet: Coding Interview Preparation Plan**

---

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1â€“4)

**Goal:** Strengthen core data structures, algorithms, and language fluency.

- **Choose Your Language**
  - Finalize one: C++, Java, Python, or Rust
  - Set up your environment (editor, compiler, formatter)

- **Core Topics**
  - Arrays & Strings
  - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees (Binary, BST)
  - Graphs (BFS/DFS)
  - Hash Tables & Heaps

- **Algorithm Patterns**
  - Two-pointer, sliding window
  - Divide & conquer, recursion
  - Dynamic programming basics
  - Greedy approaches

- **Weekly Goals**
  - Week 1: 20 array/string problems
  - Week 2: 20 linked list/tree problems
  - Week 3: 15 graph/hash/heap problems
  - Week 4: 15 DP/greedy problems

---

### Phase 2: Intensive Practice (Weeks 5â€“9)

**Goal:** Tackle harder problems, simulate time pressure, and diversify topics.

| Week | Focus                          | Problems | Deliverables                        |
|------|--------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| 5    | Mixed medium DS&A              | 25       | Solve 3 in 45 min                   |
| 6    | Hard arrays/trees/graphs       | 20       | Clean code in â‰¤50 min               |
| 7    | Advanced DP & bit manipulation | 15       | Analyze space/time trade-offs       |
| 8    | System design primer           | 3        | Sketch component diagrams           |
| 9    | Take-home assignment           | 1        | Complete and document solution      |

- Track solve time and revisit mistakes  
- Reduce average solve time by 10% weekly

---

### Phase 3: Mock Interviews & Final Polish (Weeks 10â€“12)

**Goal:** Simulate real interviews and refine communication.

- **Mock Interviews**
  - 2â€“3 per week (Pramp, Interviewing.io, peers)

- **Behavioral & System Design**
  - STAR responses for behavioral questions
  - Review projects and growth stories
  - 2â€“3 mini system design prompts/week

- **Review & Iterate**
  - Log feedback after each mock
  - Re-practice weak areas
  - Polish code style and explanations

- **Final Checklist**
  - Resume and cover letter review
  - Company-specific problem lists (LeetCode tags)
  - Rest and prep for interview day

---

### Tools & Resources

- **Platforms:** LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces  
- **Books:** *Cracking the Coding Interview*  
- **System Design:** Educative.io, Grokking the System Design Interview  
- **Tracking:** Toggl, spreadsheets, Notion

---

### After Week 12

- Deepen system design for senior roles  
- Contribute to open-source  
- Network for referrals
